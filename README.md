##  API B-Connects-App
Backend API for B-connect-apps, providing secure authentication features such as user registration and login. Empowering the Indonesian Culture App with seamless and reliable user management

## Building from Scratch

To build the B-Connects-App API from scratch, we used the following technologies and tools:

1. **RESTFUL APIs**: Designing APIs with Express.
2. **ORM Prisma**: Database modeling and interaction.
3. **Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)**: Database for storing application data.
4. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Providing secure authentication.
5. **Bcrypt**: Hashing passwords for user security.
6. **Google Cloud Run**: Deployment of the application.
7. **Unit Testing with Jest and Superbase**: Ensuring the reliability of the codebase.
8. **Documentation with Swagger & Postman**: Documenting API endpoints for easy integration.
